.SH NAME
hsh - Simple Shell: command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS FOR INTERACTIVE MODE
Type ./hsh to show prompt Command: [command] [options]

.SH SYNOPSIS NON INTERACTIVE 
echo "[command] [options]" | ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell (compiled as hsh) is a recreation of the sh command interpreter, made using C language. This version can execute any comman that points to an executable file, files with the full direction (for instance "/bin/ls") and files that can be found in the PATH environment variable (for instance "ls"). All the execution that are not built-ins are made using the execve C function.

.SH USER INPUT
Once a user inputs a command and hits enter, the shell performs the following actions:

1. Displaying the prompt.

2. Reading the command.

3. Command interpretation.

4. Command execution.

5. Waiting for the command to finish.

.SH SEARCH FOR COMMAND
When locating a command, the shell looks for a built-in command by that name.
If a built-in command is not found, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.

.SH EXECUTE COMMAND
Commands are executed in a child process of the main process.

.SH BUILT-IN
This version includes 2 built-ins (functions that are not found on PATH). env built-in prints all the environment variables. exit ends the shell.
